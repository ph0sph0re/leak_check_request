## How to Compile and Run the Rust Code

Follow these steps to compile and run the Rust program:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust**:  
    To get started with Rust, you need to have it installed on your computer.  
    You can install Rust by following the instructions on the official Rust website:  
    [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    
    If you already have Rust installed, you can check your version by running:
    
    ```bash
    rustc --version
    ```
    
2. **Install Cargo (if not already installed)**:  
    Cargo is the Rust package manager and build system. It should be installed automatically with Rust.
    
### Steps to Compile and Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
    Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Run the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ph0sph0re/leakcheck-request.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
    Change to the project directory:
    
    ```
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    
3. **Compile the Code**:  
    To compile the Rust program, run the following command:
    
    ```
    cargo build --release
    ```
    
    This will compile the program in release mode. If you want to build it in debug mode, simply run:
    
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
    
4. **Run the Program**:  
    Once the code is compiled, you can run the program with:
    
    ```
    cargo run
    ```
    

### Troubleshooting

- If you run into any issues, make sure you have the latest version of Rust installed by running:
    
    ```
    rustup update
    ```
    
- For more help with Rust, refer to the official documentation: [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
